## Introduction

This organization, owned and operated by the UCSF Department of Radiology, serves as the gateway to our UCSF Radiology GitHub ecosystem. It acts as both an organizational directory and a home for **non-research** projects.

## GitHub Platforms

UCSF Radiology maintains a presence on two GitHub platforms:

- **[github.com](https://github.com/)**: This is the public GitHub platform that's accessible to everyone, though there are limitations on the types of data that may be stored (detailed below).

- **[git.ucsf.edu](https://git.ucsf.edu/)**: This is our on-premises GitHub Enterprise deployment. It offers enhanced privacy and security measures, ensuring the protection of internal and patient data. UCSF employees and affiliates can request access through [this](https://ucsf.service-now.com/ucsfit?id=ucsf_sc_cat_item&sys_id=93bee8021b591810fd5d85507e4bcbf4) form.

## Data Classification

Projects containing **P1** and **P2** data can be hosted on either **github.com** or **git.ucsf.edu**, while projects with **P3** and/or **P4** data must be hosted on **git.ucsf.edu**. Keep in mind that only individuals with active UCSF credentials can access and view **git.ucsf.edu**.
